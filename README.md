# Purp Bux

A mod that adds money to the game! The money can be made by combining
experience and paper in the Purp Bux Station

###### This mod is basically a new version of the Svelte Bux which I made for a server

This mod uses the [Bookshelf](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bookshelf) library

### Types of releases

#### 1. Release

The release is for production ready versions.

#### 2. Pre-release

The pre-release is for almost production ready versions that still need a bit of polish.

#### 3. Dev release

The dev release is for very unstable versions. These are added almost every commit.

###### This type of release might get removed when the repo becomes public

Just a warning (I guess): I'm not working on this mod seriously, I
am working on it more seriously than other mods, but I will
still probably abandon it soon, I am using this to
learn Git, Github and Forge developlent
